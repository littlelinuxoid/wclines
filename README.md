Wclines is a smol program to look how much lines there are in your project/poem/article/whatever.

This is a learning project, you are absolutely welcome to brutally roast anything you think is bad about the code via discussions/pull requests

Wclines is inspired by me typing wc -l . .*
in the terminal for 1.7e163 times a day to see if my article had grown too large. This also might be useful to see how big your coding project is (though some needed functionality for this is not ready yet).

SOME PHILOSOPHICAL MOMENTS

1. Using third-party libraries for everything is directly against the point of a learning project IMO, so i am not using any (at least yet, though i suspect i will need to soon).

2. If you are here for some reason and want to submit a pr - feel free to.

3. You are under no obligation to be kind to my code if you think it is bullshit. You ARE obligated to start a discussion about it (:



PLANNED FUNCTIONALITY

1. Cli commands. This includes controlling recursion depth, output format, (not-)respecting .gitignore, file formats/directories to skip. 

2. Pretty-printing is not ready yet (you might be able to find some assets for it in a  table.rs file).

3. A proper readme lmao.
